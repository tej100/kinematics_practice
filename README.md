Kinematics Practice Overview!!!

This project is a series of kinematics practice questions designed to test a Physics Mechanics student (algebra-based, not calculus-based)
on the first couple topics of mechanics. The user has the option to choose how many questions to practice for the session and will then be
provided randomized questions with randomized variables. The user-input is then compared to the actual answer and the user is given their
overall test score at the end of the session. Useful for teachers to assign to students and for students to practice on their own.

If the program is actually practical for users, I will add new features, such as data storage to track progress from previous sessions and
indicate improvement, perhaps ways to visually depict the questions using some graphic libraries, add more questions and topics, etc.
